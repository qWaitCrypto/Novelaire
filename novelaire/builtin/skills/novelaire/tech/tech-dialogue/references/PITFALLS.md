# Dialogue pitfalls (and fixes)

## 1) Everyone sounds the same
- Fix: assign a voice constraint per character (syntax, favorite verbs, taboo topics).

## 2) Exposition dump
- Fix: move info into conflict, interruption, or partial disclosure.

## 3) No stakes
- Fix: define what each speaker wants and what they fear losing.

## 4) “Assistant voice”
- Fix: avoid meta summaries and tidy “conclusion lines”; keep it lived-in and imperfect.
