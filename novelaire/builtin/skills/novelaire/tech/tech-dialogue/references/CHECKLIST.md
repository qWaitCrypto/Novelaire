# Dialogue revision checklist

## Voice and character
- Each speaker has distinct syntax, rhythm, and vocabulary.
- Lines reflect the speaker’s motives and boundaries (`spec/characters/`).

## Subtext and pressure
- Every exchange has an underlying conflict or negotiation.
- What is NOT said matters (avoid total transparency).

## Economy
- Remove “as you know” exposition.
- Cut filler responses that don’t change stakes or direction.

## Beats and embodiment
- Use action beats to break up long back-and-forth.
- Let physical reactions and environment carry meaning.

## Plausibility
- People avoid saying the obvious when it costs them.
- Emotional reactions are specific, not generic praise/summary.
