## Lexicon (word choice)
- Preferred words / phrasing:
- Words they avoid (taboos, “not my vibe”, too formal/informal):
- Domain vocabulary (technical terms vs everyday terms):

## Syntax & rhythm (how sentences feel)
- Typical sentence length (short / medium / long):
- Fragment habit (rare / sometimes / often):
- Punctuation flavor (commas, dashes, ellipses, none):
- Typical turn-taking (interrupts, waits, talks over, asks questions):
