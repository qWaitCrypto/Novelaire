# Scene structure pitfalls (and fixes)

## 1) No turn
- Fix: add a consequence, new information, or forced choice.

## 2) No obstacle
- Fix: add a blocking force (character, faction, rule, internal boundary).

## 3) Drift scenes
- Fix: reconnect to premise promise and current arc goal; cut or repurpose.

## 4) Consequence-free action
- Fix: attach faction/world/system responses; carry state forward in continuity.
