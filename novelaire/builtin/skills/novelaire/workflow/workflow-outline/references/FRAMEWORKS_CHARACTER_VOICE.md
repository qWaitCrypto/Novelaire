# Creative Writing Frameworks — Character Development & Voice

## Character Development

### The Character Diamond

Four dimensions that create compelling characters.

```
                    WANT
                (External Goal)
                      │
                      │
         ┌───────────┼───────────┐
         │           │           │
         │           │           │
    FEAR ├───────────┼───────────┤ NEED
(What holds         │         (Internal
 them back)         │           Goal)
         │           │           │
         │           │           │
         └───────────┼───────────┘
                      │
                      │
                   WOUND
              (Origin of Fear)
```

**Example:**

```yaml
Character: Marcus, reluctant hero

Want: "To be left alone and run my bookshop"
Need: "To find belonging and purpose"
Fear: "Being responsible for others' suffering"
Wound: "Caused his sister's death through negligence"

Dynamic: Marcus's want (isolation) and need (belonging)
         are in direct conflict. His fear prevents him
         from what he truly needs. The story forces him
         to confront this through events that require
         him to take responsibility for others.
```

### Character Voice Checklist

What makes a character's voice distinctive:

```yaml
Voice Components:
  Vocabulary:
    - Education level (sesquipedalian vs simple)
    - Regional influences (y'all, wicked, hella)
    - Professional jargon (legal, medical, tech)
    - Era-specific terms (groovy, based, lit)

  Rhythm:
    - Sentence length patterns (short, punchy vs flowing)
    - Pause patterns (em-dashes, ellipses, periods)
    - Question frequency
    - Exclamation usage

  Perspective:
    - Optimist vs pessimist
    - Internal vs external focus
    - Past vs future orientation
    - Self vs other focus

  Quirks:
    - Catchphrases
    - Verbal tics (you know, like, basically)
    - Topics they always return to
    - Things they never mention
```

### The OCEAN Model for Personality

Use psychological traits to build consistent characters.

| Trait | Low | High |
|-------|-----|------|
| **O**penness | Practical, conventional | Creative, curious |
| **C**onscientiousness | Flexible, spontaneous | Organized, disciplined |
| **E**xtraversion | Reserved, solitary | Outgoing, energetic |
| **A**greeableness | Challenging, detached | Cooperative, trusting |
| **N**euroticism | Calm, secure | Anxious, volatile |

## Voice Development

### Finding Your Voice

Voice emerges from consistent choices across these dimensions:

```yaml
Voice Framework:

  Formality Spectrum:
    Casual ←──────────────────────→ Formal
    "Hey!" ←──────────────────────→ "Greetings"

  Complexity Spectrum:
    Simple ←──────────────────────→ Complex
    "It's hot" ←──────────────────→ "The ambient temperature..."

  Distance Spectrum:
    Intimate ←──────────────────────→ Distant
    "Between us..." ←──────────────→ "One might observe..."

  Pace Spectrum:
    Staccato ←──────────────────────→ Flowing
    "Stop. Think. Act." ←────────→ "And as the moment unfolds..."

  Emotional Range:
    Restrained ←──────────────────→ Expressive
    "That's unfortunate" ←───────→ "This is devastating!"
```

### Voice Consistency Patterns

```yaml
Voice Pattern: [Name]

# Sentence Starters (common openers)
- [Pattern 1]
- [Pattern 2]
- [Pattern 3]

# Transitional Phrases
- [Phrase 1]
- [Phrase 2]

# Emphasis Patterns
- How do they stress importance?
- What punctuation do they favor?

# Forbidden Patterns
- Things this voice would NEVER say
- Words that break character

# Rhythm Example
[Write a sample paragraph demonstrating the voice]
```

### Avoiding AI Voice Patterns

Common patterns to eliminate for authentic voice:

```yaml
AI Patterns to Avoid:

  Over-qualification:
    Bad: "It's important to note that..."
    Good: [Just say the thing]

  Excessive hedging:
    Bad: "This could potentially be seen as..."
    Good: "This is..." or "This might be..."

  List dependency:
    Bad: "First... Second... Third... Finally..."
    Good: [Vary structure, integrate points]

  Empty transitions:
    Bad: "Moving on to the next point..."
    Good: [Direct connection or none]

  Overly balanced:
    Bad: "On one hand... on the other hand..."
    Good: [Take a position, acknowledge nuance naturally]

  Superlative stacking:
    Bad: "Incredibly powerful and remarkably effective"
    Good: "Effective" or "Powerful"
```
