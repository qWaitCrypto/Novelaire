# Outline pitfalls (and fixes)

## 1) Premise drift
- Symptom: outline becomes a different story than promised.
- Fix: keep premise snapshot visible; reject beats that don’t serve the promise.

## 2) System-cheating solutions
- Symptom: problems solved by new powers or author fiat.
- Fix: anchor to system rules; add costs/limits or redesign beats.

## 3) Too detailed too early
- Symptom: outline becomes scene prose.
- Fix: keep it structural; push detail to fine-outline.

## 4) Missing consequences
- Symptom: actions don’t trigger faction/world responses.
- Fix: encode reaction beats; anchor to faction/world constraints.
