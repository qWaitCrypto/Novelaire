# Creative Writing Frameworks — Scene Construction & Checklists

## Scene Construction

### Scene Purpose Checklist

Every scene must accomplish at least two:

- [ ] Advance the plot
- [ ] Reveal character
- [ ] Provide necessary information
- [ ] Create emotional resonance
- [ ] Establish or change setting
- [ ] Increase tension/stakes

### Scene Structure Template

```yaml
Scene: [Name]

Setup:
  POV: Who experiences this?
  Location: Where?
  Time: When?
  Characters Present: Who's here?
  Goal: What does POV character want in this scene?

Conflict:
  Obstacle: What prevents the goal?
  Stakes: What happens if they fail?

Resolution:
  Outcome: Success / Failure / Partial / Complicated
  Change: How is situation different at scene end?
  Hook: What pulls reader to next scene?

Beats:
  1. [First beat - typically establishing]
  2. [Second beat - complication]
  3. [Third beat - escalation]
  4. [Fourth beat - turning point]
  5. [Fifth beat - resolution/hook]
```

### Dialogue Craft

```yaml
Dialogue Principles:

  Subtext Over Text:
    - Characters rarely say exactly what they mean
    - Conflict lives between the lines
    - Let readers infer

  Distinct Voices:
    - Each character speaks differently
    - Remove dialogue tags; can you tell who's speaking?
    - Vocabulary, rhythm, concerns should vary

  Compression:
    - Cut pleasantries unless characterizing
    - Enter scenes late, leave early
    - Every line should work

  Action Beats:
    - Replace "said" with meaningful action
    - Show emotion through physicality
    - Pace with beats

Example:
  Bad:
    "I'm really angry at you," she said angrily.

  Better:
    Sarah's coffee cup hit the table. "You knew."
```

## Content Narrative Frameworks

### Problem-Agitation-Solution (PAS)

Classic framework for persuasive content.

```
PROBLEM
  │ Identify the pain point
  │ "Are you struggling with X?"
  │
  ▼
AGITATION
  │ Twist the knife (empathetically)
  │ "And isn't it frustrating when..."
  │
  ▼
SOLUTION
    Present your answer
    "Here's how to fix it..."
```

### Before-After-Bridge (BAB)

Show transformation.

```
BEFORE
  │ Current painful state
  │
  ▼
AFTER
  │ Desirable future state
  │
  ▼
BRIDGE
    How to get there
```

### AIDA for Narrative Content

Attention → Interest → Desire → Action

```yaml
Attention:
  - Hook that stops the scroll
  - Unexpected opening
  - Bold claim or question

Interest:
  - Story that illustrates the point
  - Data that surprises
  - Insight that reframes

Desire:
  - Benefits clearly stated
  - Social proof
  - Future pacing

Action:
  - Clear next step
  - Low friction
  - Urgency without manipulation
```
