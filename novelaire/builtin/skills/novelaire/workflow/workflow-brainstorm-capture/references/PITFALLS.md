# Brainstorm capture pitfalls (and fixes)

## 1) Premature canon
- Symptom: brainstorming note reads like finalized spec.
- Fix: label hypotheses/options explicitly; only move confirmed items to `spec/` later.

## 2) Collapsing to one option too early
- Symptom: agent picks a favorite and discards alternatives.
- Fix: keep at least two viable options and record trade-offs.

## 3) Inventing facts to fill gaps
- Symptom: details appear without user confirmation.
- Fix: turn missing information into open questions.

## 4) Notes that are unusable later
- Symptom: big prose blob with no structure.
- Fix: use headings and bullets; keep it searchable.
