# Brainstorm capture questions (ask only what’s missing)

Use these to clarify the exploration target without forcing premature decisions.

## Minimal set

1) What are we designing right now (premise/world/system/characters/etc.)?
2) What constraints are already confirmed (non-negotiables)?
3) What are the top 3 unknowns that block progress?
4) What options are on the table (at least 2)?
