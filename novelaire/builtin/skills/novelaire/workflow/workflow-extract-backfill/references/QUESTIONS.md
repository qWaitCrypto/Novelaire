# Extraction/backfill questions (ask only what’s missing)

Use these when you need to turn conversation into canon.

## Minimal set

1) Which items are explicitly confirmed by the user (non-negotiable)?
2) Which items are still options/hypotheses?
3) Which spec domain does each confirmed item belong to?
4) Do we need to create new entries or update existing ids?
