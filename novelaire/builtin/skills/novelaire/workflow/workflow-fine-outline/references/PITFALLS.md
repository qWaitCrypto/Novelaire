# Fine-outline pitfalls (and fixes)

## 1) Beats without causality
- Symptom: a list of events but no cause → effect logic.
- Fix: write each beat as trigger → action → consequence.

## 2) Missing constraints
- Symptom: the plan ignores system limits, continuity, or premise promise.
- Fix: add anchors at key ambiguity points; revise beats until compliant.

## 3) Too short / too vague
- Symptom: chapter plan can’t guide drafting, invites drift.
- Fix: expand stakes, obstacles, and beat consequences; enforce Han > 500.

## 4) Prose disguised as plan
- Symptom: long narrative paragraphs appear in fine-outline.
- Fix: keep it structured and bullet-driven; save prose for chapters.
