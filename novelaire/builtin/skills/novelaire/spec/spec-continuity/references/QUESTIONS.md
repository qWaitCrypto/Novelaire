# Continuity questions (ask only what’s missing)

Use these when contradictions or “state reset” risks appear.

## Minimum set (usually enough)

1) **What must persist?**
- List 5–15 state variables that cannot reset without explanation.

2) **Who knows what?**
- Any critical secrets/knowledge states that must be tracked?

3) **Ownership and access**
- What items/permissions are frequently transferred and must be consistent?

4) **Invariants**
- Name 3–7 invariants that must not contradict across chapters.

## Optional clarifiers (only if needed)

- Which variables are tracked in timeline entries vs continuity trackers.
