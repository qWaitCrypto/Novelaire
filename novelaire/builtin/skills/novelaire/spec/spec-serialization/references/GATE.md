# Serialization Gate (PASS/WARN/FAIL)

Use this to evaluate whether `spec/serialization/` meaningfully constrains structure without becoming an outline.

## PASS

- Chapter length targets and cadence are explicit.
- Hook and payoff policies are checkable.
- Recap policy prevents bloat.
- Principles guide outline/fine-outline without encoding beats.

## WARN

- Policies exist but are vague (“good pacing”).
- Hook/payoff rules do not match premise promise.
- Spec is growing long and brittle.

## FAIL

- No stable serialization constraints exist despite serialized target.
- Recap/hook/payoff behavior drifts wildly.
- Spec is effectively a chapter outline.
