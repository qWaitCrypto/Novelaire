# Serialization pitfalls (and fixes)

## 1) Recap bloat
- Symptom: too much recap slows chapters.
- Fix: define recap policy and keep it light.

## 2) Cheap hooks
- Symptom: constant cliffhangers that feel manipulative.
- Fix: define hook policy that matches premise promise; avoid bait-and-switch.

## 3) Payoff starvation
- Symptom: mysteries/promise stack without resolution.
- Fix: set payoff cadence and enforce it in outline/fine-outline.

## 4) Turning serialization spec into an outline
- Symptom: spec contains chapter-by-chapter structure.
- Fix: keep it principle-level; leave structure to outline.
