# Serialization questions (ask only what’s missing)

Use these when the project has a release model (serialized reading) that should shape structure.

## Minimum set (usually enough)

1) **Target chapter length**
- Range and minimums (especially for fine-outline).

2) **Update cadence**
- Daily/weekly/irregular? Any platform constraints?

3) **Hook style**
- How strong should end hooks be? What kind (revelation, danger, emotional turn)?

4) **Payoff expectation**
- How many chapters can a promise hang before it must pay off?

## Optional clarifiers (only if needed)

- Recap frequency and acceptable forms.
- Arc/volume size preferences.
