# Objects Gate (PASS/WARN/FAIL)

Use this to evaluate whether `spec/objects/` prevents props from becoming plot convenience.

## PASS

- Properties are stable; limits/failure are explicit.
- “Cannot” boundaries prevent loopholes.
- Ownership/flow is defined when it matters to consequences.
- Interfaces with `spec/system/` are clear (without duplicating mechanics).

## WARN

- Capabilities exist but limits/failure are vague.
- Ownership is implied but not tracked.
- The entry bundles multiple unrelated objects/resources.

## FAIL

- Objects behave differently per scene convenience.
- No meaningful limits/costs exist.
- Contradictions with `spec/system/` or `spec/world/` remain unresolved.
