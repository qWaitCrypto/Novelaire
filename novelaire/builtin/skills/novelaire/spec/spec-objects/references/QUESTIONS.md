# Object questions (ask only what’s missing)

Use these when an item/resource matters repeatedly or risks becoming a “plot button”.

## Minimum set (usually enough)

1) **What is it?**
- One sentence definition (function, not vibe).

2) **What can it do (and not do)?**
- 2–5 allowed functions + explicit “cannot”.

3) **How is it used?**
- Preconditions, procedure, required inputs.

4) **What are its limits/failures?**
- Caps, depletion, breakage, detectable side effects.

5) **Who owns it and how does it move?**
- Ownership, transfer constraints, scarcity.

## Optional clarifiers (only if needed)

- Countermeasures and exploitation boundaries.
- Legal/institutional consequences of possession/use.
