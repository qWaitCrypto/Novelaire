# Location questions (ask only what’s missing)

Use these when a place will recur, or when scenes produce spatial/continuity confusion.

## Minimum set (usually enough)

1) **What is it for?**
- Narrative function (hideout, arena, trap, safehouse, bureaucracy, etc.).

2) **What must stay stable?**
- 3–7 continuity anchors (layout landmarks, key rooms, sensory cues).

3) **Who can enter and how?**
- Access rules, checks, permissions, costs, chokepoints.

4) **What are the constraints/dangers?**
- What you cannot do there; what triggers consequences.

5) **How do people move through it?**
- Entrances/exits, movement constraints, escape routes (as needed).

## Optional clarifiers (only if needed)

- Surveillance baseline and blind spots.
- Time/distance to other key locations (or link to `spec/world/` / `spec/timeline/`).
