# Locations Gate (PASS/WARN/FAIL)

Use this to evaluate whether `spec/locations/` supports reuse and prevents continuity errors.

## PASS

- Stable anchors exist (layout/landmarks) and are reusable.
- Access rules + consequences are explicit enough to constrain action.
- Dangers/constraints create tension without ad-hoc rules.
- Entries are stable canon, not plot beats.

## WARN

- Anchors exist but access rules are vague.
- Security/dangers are hinted but not operational.
- Too much micro-detail (hard to keep consistent).

## FAIL

- Location changes per scene convenience.
- Access/constraints are undefined, causing continuity errors.
- Contradictions with `spec/world/` or `spec/factions/` are unresolved.
