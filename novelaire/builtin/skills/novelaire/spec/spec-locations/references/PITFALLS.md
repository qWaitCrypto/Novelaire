# Location pitfalls (and fixes)

## 1) Vibes-only locations
- Symptom: atmospheric description, but nothing constrains action.
- Fix: encode access rules and consequences; add stable anchors.

## 2) “Teleport geography”
- Symptom: travel time and access change per scene.
- Fix: specify entry points, chokepoints, and constraints; link to world/timeline if needed.

## 3) Reuse contradictions
- Symptom: layout/details change between chapters.
- Fix: keep a small set of stable anchors; avoid excessive micro-detail.

## 4) Security appears/disappears
- Symptom: guards/cameras exist only when convenient.
- Fix: define baseline security + what changes it.

## 5) Plot beats disguised as canon
- Symptom: the entry narrates a specific chapter scene.
- Fix: move beats to outline; keep this entry reusable.
