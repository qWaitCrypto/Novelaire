# Style Profile

## Voice Contract
- Tone and attitude (what the narrator sounds like):
- Emotional texture (how feelings show up on the page):
- Reader distance (close/intimate vs distant/observational):

## Rhythm / Density Targets
- Sentence rhythm (short/long mix; punch vs flow):
- Description density (lean vs rich; what to prioritize):
- Interior monologue / reflection (how much, when):

## Dialogue & Description Balance (optional)
- Preferred balance:
- Dialogue texture (subtext, interruptions, silence, etc.):

## Non-negotiables (must avoid)
- What the prose must not do (e.g., meta-summaries, generic praise, repetitive transitions):

## Preferred Moves (optional)
- Moves that reliably feel “natural” for this project:

## Examples (optional)
- A short sample paragraph that is “on-voice” (best if user-provided):

## Implications (for outline / fine-outline)
- What downstream work must respect:

## Cross-links (optional)
- Related spec ids:
  - `@spec:narrative/...`
  - `@spec:premise/...`
