# Style Gate (PASS/WARN/FAIL)

Use this to evaluate whether `spec/style/` stabilizes voice without bloating.

## PASS

- A short, enforceable voice contract exists.
- Density/rhythm targets are clear enough to guide writing.
- Non-negotiables address actual drift modes (meta-summaries, generic praise, repetition).
- It’s minimal and reusable; not a giant manual.

## WARN

- Voice is described but constraints are vague.
- Non-negotiables exist but do not map to real failure modes.
- The profile is growing long and brittle.

## FAIL

- No stable voice constraints exist (everything is ad-hoc).
- The prose keeps drifting into assistant voice without correction.
- The style spec is so long it’s unusable in practice.
