# Style pitfalls (and fixes)

## 1) Overlong style manuals
- Symptom: spec/style becomes huge and hard to follow.
- Fix: keep a short voice contract; move details into optional technique skills.

## 2) Vague style goals
- Symptom: “write beautifully” but no constraints prevent drift.
- Fix: define enforceable non-negotiables + a few preferred moves.

## 3) Mixing POV rules into style
- Symptom: style file tries to define knowledge boundaries and POV mechanics.
- Fix: move those to `spec/narrative/`.

## 4) “Assistant voice” leakage
- Symptom: meta summaries, generic praise, overly tidy structure in prose.
- Fix: ban meta-summaries; enforce concrete scene language; vary rhythm and specificity.

## 5) Micro-level bans that create stiffness
- Symptom: giant forbidden word lists; prose becomes unnatural.
- Fix: keep bans principle-level; allow natural variation; focus on repeated failure modes.
