# Style questions (ask only what’s missing)

Use these when voice drifts or when the project needs a stable “natural” prose contract.

## Minimum set (usually enough)

1) **Voice**
- What should the narration *sound like* (cool, sharp, tender, cynical, lyrical, etc.)?

2) **Density**
- Lean vs rich? What should be described most (action, sensation, atmosphere, interiority)?

3) **Dialogue texture**
- More direct/clean vs subtext-heavy? Any signature habits (interruptions, silence)?

4) **Non-negotiables**
- List 3–7 things to avoid (generic summaries, “as an AI” tone, repetitive connectors, etc.).

## Optional clarifiers (only if needed)

- Provide 1–2 user-written paragraphs to match.
- If multiple POV voices exist, which ones need distinct style profiles?
