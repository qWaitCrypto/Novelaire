# Timeline questions (ask only what’s missing)

Use these when continuity/time pressure is unclear or when you foresee “time drift”.

## Minimum set (usually enough)

1) **Time scale**
- Days/weeks/months/years? Are there time skips?

2) **Hard anchors**
- Name 3–7 events that must not move (inciting incident, exposure, deadline, irreversible change).

3) **Non-negotiable order**
- Which events must happen before/after others? Any strict dependencies?

4) **Pressure clocks**
- What deadlines drive decisions? What changes when time runs out?

5) **Travel/communication constraints**
- Anything that makes timing plausible/tense (distance, latency, bureaucracy)?

## Optional clarifiers (only if needed)

- Knowledge sequence: who learns what when (link to `spec/continuity/` if you track there).
- Cooldowns/recovery time for system abilities (link to `spec/system/`).
