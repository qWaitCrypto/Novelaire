# Quality questions (ask only what’s missing)

Use these when the project needs explicit “done” criteria and gates.

## Minimum set (usually enough)

1) **What are the big failure modes?**
- Premise drift, system cheating, continuity breaks, style drift, etc.

2) **What blocks downstream work?**
- Define FAIL conditions (hard stops).

3) **What deserves warnings?**
- Define WARN signals (investigate/fix soon).

4) **What is “good enough”?**
- Define PASS criteria (minimum acceptable).

5) **Any stable numeric thresholds?**
- Fine-outline minimum length, chapter length ranges, etc.
