# Quality Gate Gate (PASS/WARN/FAIL)

Use this to evaluate whether `spec/quality/` is operational and worth its cost.

## PASS

- Gates are minimal, high-leverage, and checkable.
- PASS/WARN/FAIL criteria exist for the key artifacts.
- Thresholds are stable and justified.

## WARN

- Gates exist but some criteria are vague.
- The gate set is growing without evidence of value.

## FAIL

- Gates are uncheckable or purely subjective.
- The process blocks progress without preventing rework.
