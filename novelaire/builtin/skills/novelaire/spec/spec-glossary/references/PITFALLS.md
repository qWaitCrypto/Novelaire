# Glossary pitfalls (and fixes)

## 1) Definitions that are too long
- Symptom: term entry becomes an essay.
- Fix: define in one sentence + usage contexts; link to other spec entries if needed.

## 2) Unenforced naming
- Symptom: the same concept has 3 names across chapters.
- Fix: set a required naming rule + forbidden alternatives (only if needed).

## 3) Hidden disambiguation
- Symptom: a term has multiple meanings depending on context.
- Fix: explicitly list “not the same as” and related terms.

## 4) Style debates inside glossary
- Symptom: glossary becomes a tone/voice argument.
- Fix: keep it lexical/semantic; move style concerns to `spec/style/`.
