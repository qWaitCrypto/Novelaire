# Glossary Gate (PASS/WARN/FAIL)

Use this to evaluate whether `spec/glossary/` reduces ambiguity and drift.

## PASS

- Key terms have short, operational definitions.
- Disambiguation prevents overloaded meanings.
- Required naming is set where inconsistency causes drift.
- Forbidden naming exists only when necessary (not a giant banlist).

## WARN

- Definitions exist but usage contexts are unclear.
- Disambiguation is incomplete.
- Naming rules are inconsistent across entries.

## FAIL

- Terminology drifts across outline/chapters.
- Readers can’t tell what a term means.
- Glossary entries are essays with no enforceable naming.
