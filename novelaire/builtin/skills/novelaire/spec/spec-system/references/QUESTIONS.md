# System questions (ask only what’s missing)

Use these when `spec/system/` is missing or when a plot beat feels like a “new power button”.

Ask the minimum set needed to make the mechanism checkable.

## Minimum set (usually enough)

1) **What is the mechanism?**
- Describe it in one plain sentence (what it does, not how cool it feels).

2) **Who can use it (and why)?**
- Eligibility, prerequisites, training, materials, permissions.

3) **How is it triggered / executed?**
- Preconditions + trigger + required steps.

4) **What does it cost?**
- Resources, risk, time, social exposure, damage, debt, moral cost.

5) **What are its limits?**
- Range, duration, frequency, caps, scaling ceilings, context dependence.

6) **How can it fail / be countered?**
- Failure modes + typical counters (and the counters’ own boundaries).

## Optional clarifiers (only if needed)

- Observability: who can detect it, how, and what detection implies.
- Edge cases: what it explicitly cannot do (to prevent loopholes).
