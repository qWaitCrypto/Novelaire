# System pitfalls (and fixes)

## 1) “Vibe rules” that can’t be checked
- Symptom: entries are atmospheric but do not constrain decisions.
- Fix: rewrite as trigger → cost → limits → failure → counters.

## 2) Omnipotent systems (no cost, no cap)
- Symptom: any problem can be solved by “using the system”.
- Fix: add meaningful scarcity, trade-offs, hard caps, and irreversible consequences.

## 3) Sudden exceptions / late retcons
- Symptom: a new rule appears exactly when the plot needs it.
- Fix: require new capability to be paid for (setup, training, resource pipeline, risk), and retrofit upstream outline.

## 4) Missing failure modes
- Symptom: the mechanism always works unless the author says otherwise.
- Fix: specify failure shapes and how characters mitigate them (within bounds).

## 5) Counterplay becomes “infinite negation”
- Symptom: counters erase tension (“the villain cancels everything”).
- Fix: bound counters with their own costs/limits and ensure some moves remain meaningful.

## 6) Mixing domains
- Symptom: institutional/world facts or character biography is written as “system”.
- Fix: move baseline reality to `spec/world/` and personal truths to `spec/characters/`.
