# Premise pitfalls (and how to fix)

## Pitfall: “Premise = outline”
**Symptom:** the premise entry contains chapter beats, act structure, or a sequence of events.  
**Fix:** move beats to `outline/`; keep premise at the promise + conflict spine level.

## Pitfall: “Premise = vibes”
**Symptom:** only adjectives (“dark”, “epic”, “cyberpunk”) with no testable promise or conflict.  
**Fix:** require a logline + stakes + what constitutes payoff.

## Pitfall: Hidden genre contract
**Symptom:** the work reads like one genre but is promised as another; reader promise is vague.  
**Fix:** state explicit promise and anti-promise (what you will not do).

## Pitfall: Theme as slogan
**Symptom:** theme is a generic motto (“love is everything”) with no tension.  
**Fix:** express theme as a question/tension that can be argued through conflict outcomes.

## Pitfall: Non-negotiables are actually system/world rules
**Symptom:** premise file encodes mechanics (“time travel rules”, “magic cost”).  
**Fix:** move to `spec/system/` or `spec/world/`; keep premise focused on contract.
