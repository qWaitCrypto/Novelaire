# Premise questions (ask only what’s missing)

Use these when `spec/premise/` is missing or when drift is suspected. Ask the minimum set needed to make the premise testable.

## Minimum set (usually enough)

1) **Protagonist + desire (start state)**
- Who is the protagonist at the story start, and what do they want that isn’t trivial?

2) **Opposition + why escalation is unavoidable**
- What (person/organization/system/self) blocks them, and why can’t they simply walk away?

3) **Stakes**
- What is lost if they fail (personal + external)? What becomes impossible to recover?

4) **Reader promise**
- What experience are we committing to deliver? (tone/genre expectations/emotional arc/payoff types)
- What are we explicitly **not** delivering? (anti-promise)

5) **Resolution direction (not plot beats)**
- What does a satisfying resolution look like *in principle*? (e.g., “truth exposed”, “system broken”, “relationship choice made”)

## Optional clarifiers (only if needed)

- **Theme in one question**: what question should the story keep returning to?
- **Non-negotiables**: list 1–3 things that must not be violated (worldview, ending constraint, character line).
- **Drift diagnosis**: name one “tempting direction” that would betray the promise (so we can recognize it early).
