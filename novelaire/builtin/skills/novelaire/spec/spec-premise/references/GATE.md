# Premise Gate (Gate Report checklist)

Use this to decide whether premise is “usable” for downstream outline/fine-outline work.

## PASS (minimum)

- Logline exists and is specific enough to judge drift.
- Core conflict is named (who vs who/what) and escalation pressure is plausible.
- Stakes are clear (what is lost).
- Reader promise is explicit (what experience/payoff is promised).
- At least 1–3 non-negotiables exist (constraints that future work must obey).

## FAIL (block downstream)

- No reader promise (cannot tell what “satisfying” means).
- No core conflict (story direction cannot be evaluated).
- Premise contradicts itself (two incompatible promises or conflict directions).

## WARN (can proceed, but track)

- Theme is present but still vague.
- Stakes exist but are only abstract (“everything changes”) with no concrete loss.
- Non-negotiables are too many or too brittle (risk of over-constraining).
