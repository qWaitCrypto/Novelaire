# Character questions (ask only what’s missing)

Use these when `spec/characters/` is empty, or when behavior feels convenient / OOC.

Ask the minimum set needed to constrain decisions.

## Minimum set (usually enough)

1) **Role + stakes**
- What is this character for (function in the story), and what do they stand to lose?

2) **North-star goal**
- What do they want long-term (even if they deny it)?

3) **Boundary**
- Name 1–3 “will not / cannot” constraints that will stay true under pressure.

4) **Resources**
- What reliable resources/skills do they have, and what limits them?

5) **Relationship constraints**
- Who matters most to them (or controls them), and how does that constrain choices?

6) **State variables**
- What must be tracked across chapters (injury, debt, secret-known-by, permissions, possession)?

## Optional clarifiers (only if needed)

- Core wound / shame / trauma that shapes reflexes.
- Red-line triggers (what reliably makes them break composure).
- What they believe (right/wrong) even when it hurts them.
