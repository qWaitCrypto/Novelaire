# Character pitfalls (and fixes)

## 1) Trait lists instead of constraints
- Symptom: “smart, kind, brave” but you still can’t predict choices.
- Fix: rewrite as motives + boundaries + resource ceilings + relationship constraints.

## 2) Everyone can do everything
- Symptom: competence magically appears per scene.
- Fix: specify what they can do reliably, and what they cannot do (or can only do at cost).

## 3) Motivation drift
- Symptom: the character’s goal changes to serve plot convenience.
- Fix: lock a north-star goal + what they refuse to sacrifice; update outline to fit.

## 4) Missing knowledge state
- Symptom: they act on information they shouldn’t have.
- Fix: add a “state variables” section and track who knows what, when.

## 5) Relationship fog
- Symptom: alliances/enmities appear/disappear without consequences.
- Fix: define a small, stable relationship map and what each relationship demands.

## 6) Plot beats disguised as canon
- Symptom: the entry says “in chapter 12 they…” (brittle).
- Fix: move beats to outline/fine-outline; keep this file stable.
