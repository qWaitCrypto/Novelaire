# Characters Gate (PASS/WARN/FAIL)

Use this to evaluate whether `spec/characters/` prevents OOC and supports consistent decisions.

## PASS

- Each main character has a clear north-star goal + what they refuse to sacrifice.
- Boundaries (“will not / cannot / would only if”) are explicit and usable.
- Resources/capabilities include meaningful ceilings/limits.
- Knowledge/state variables are trackable across chapters.
- Entries are stable canon, not plot beats.

## WARN

- Motive exists but boundaries are vague (“they’re a good person”).
- Resources are listed but limits/costs are missing.
- Relationships exist but do not constrain decisions.
- Knowledge tracking is incomplete.

## FAIL

- You cannot predict choices from the entries.
- Characters behave as the scene needs (convenience overrides canon).
- Major contradictions with `spec/premise/` or `spec/world/` are unresolved.
- Entries are essentially a chapter outline.
