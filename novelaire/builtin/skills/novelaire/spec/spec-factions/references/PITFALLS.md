# Faction pitfalls (and fixes)

## 1) Abstract factions with no levers
- Symptom: “powerful organization” but no concrete actions.
- Fix: list specific levers and where they apply.

## 2) Omnipotent factions
- Symptom: can solve any problem instantly (kills tension).
- Fix: add jurisdiction limits, scarcity, political constraints, and bounded reaction patterns.

## 3) Factions that don’t create consequences
- Symptom: protagonists act and nothing institutional happens.
- Fix: define predictable response patterns; attach consequences to common triggers.

## 4) Relationship chaos
- Symptom: allies/enemies flip without explanation.
- Fix: define stable alliances/dependencies and why they persist.

## 5) Plot beats disguised as canon
- Symptom: “they attack in chapter X” inside `spec/`.
- Fix: move beats to outline/fine-outline; keep this entry reusable.
