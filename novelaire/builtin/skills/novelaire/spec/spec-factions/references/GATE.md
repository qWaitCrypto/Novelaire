# Factions Gate (PASS/WARN/FAIL)

Use this to evaluate whether `spec/factions/` creates consistent structural pressure.

## PASS

- Goals and levers are concrete and usable.
- Limits/constraints prevent omnipotence.
- Reaction patterns make consequences predictable.
- Relationships + internal constraints are defined enough to create conflict.
- Entries are stable canon, not plot beats.

## WARN

- Levers are present but limits are vague.
- Reaction patterns exist but escalation boundaries are unclear.
- Internal fractures are hinted but not operational.

## FAIL

- Factions are “vibes” (no levers, no constraints).
- Consequences are ad-hoc per scene.
- Contradictions with `spec/world/` or `spec/system/` remain unresolved.
