# Faction questions (ask only what’s missing)

Use these when `spec/factions/` is missing or when consequences feel weightless.

## Minimum set (usually enough)

1) **What do they want?**
- One sentence goal + what success looks like.

2) **What can they mobilize?**
- 2–5 concrete levers (money, force, law, media, logistics, surveillance, etc.).

3) **What stops them?**
- Hard limits (resources, jurisdiction, tech caps) + internal constraints (politics, corruption, fractures).

4) **How do they usually act?**
- Preferred tactics and escalation pattern.

5) **What happens when they’re challenged?**
- Predictable retaliation / containment / negotiation behaviors.

## Optional clarifiers (only if needed)

- Public narrative vs private agenda.
- Internal sub-factions and fault lines.
