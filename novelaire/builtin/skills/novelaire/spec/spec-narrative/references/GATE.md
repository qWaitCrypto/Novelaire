# Narrative Gate (PASS/WARN/FAIL)

Use this to evaluate whether `spec/narrative/` keeps suspense fair and POV consistent.

## PASS

- POV mode and switching rules are explicit.
- Knowledge boundaries prevent leaks and omniscient convenience.
- Reveal discipline prevents premature answers and exposition dumps.
- Forbidden shortcuts are clearly listed.
- Rules are enforceable constraints, not vague advice.

## WARN

- POV rules exist but switching boundaries are unclear.
- Knowledge boundaries are stated but not operational.
- Forbidden shortcuts are incomplete; “cheating” still possible.

## FAIL

- Narration can reveal anything at any time (no constraints).
- Head-hopping or omniscient spoilers undermine suspense.
- Major contradictions with `spec/premise/` reader promise are unresolved.
