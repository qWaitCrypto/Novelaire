# Narrative pitfalls (and fixes)

## 1) POV drift
- Symptom: viewpoint switches inside a scene, causing leaks/confusion.
- Fix: set explicit POV switching rules.

## 2) Omniscient convenience
- Symptom: narrator explains what characters can’t know, killing suspense.
- Fix: define knowledge boundaries and forbid omniscient answers.

## 3) Exposition as a weapon
- Symptom: tension is resolved by author explanation, not scene action.
- Fix: constrain exposition; require “show before state”.

## 4) “Cheating reveals”
- Symptom: mysteries are answered without fair setup.
- Fix: define reveal prerequisites and cadence; link to `spec/modules/mystery/` if relevant.

## 5) Mixing style with discipline
- Symptom: narrative rules become an aesthetic manifesto.
- Fix: keep hard constraints here; put stylistic preferences in `spec/style/` or technique skills.
