# Narrative questions (ask only what’s missing)

Use these when POV/knowledge boundaries are unclear or when suspense feels unfair.

## Minimum set (usually enough)

1) **POV mode**
- Single POV or multi POV? How often can it switch, and when?

2) **Knowledge boundary**
- What MUST the narration not reveal early (mysteries, motives, true causes)?

3) **Reveal discipline**
- What must be shown before the narrator can state it?

4) **Forbidden shortcuts**
- List 3–7 things the narration must not do (head-hop, omniscient answers, hard exposition to solve scenes).

## Optional clarifiers (only if needed)

- Flashback/time-jump policy.
- Content red lines if the project needs them.
