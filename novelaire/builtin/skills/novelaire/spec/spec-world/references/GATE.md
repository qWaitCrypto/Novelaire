# World Gate (Gate Report checklist)

Use this to decide whether world constraints are “usable” for downstream outline/fine-outline work.

## PASS (minimum)

- At least one entry describes baseline daily-life reality (what’s normal).
- Institutions and enforcement are concrete enough to create consequences.
- Scarcity/resource ceilings exist (something is limited and matters).
- At least 2–5 hard constraints/impossibilities are stated plainly.

## FAIL (block downstream)

- World is only vibes; no constraints exist to judge plausibility.
- Core world facts contradict each other (can’t tell what is true).

## WARN (can proceed, but track)

- Constraints exist but enforcement is unclear.
- Logistics (travel/communication) is undefined while plot depends on it.
