# World pitfalls (and how to fix)

## Pitfall: “World = moodboard”
**Symptom:** only aesthetic labels (“cyberpunk”, “grimdark”) with no constraints.  
**Fix:** add at least 2–5 hard constraints and 1–3 resource/institution facts that produce consequences.

## Pitfall: “World changes per scene”
**Symptom:** laws, logistics, or public behavior shift to fit the current chapter.  
**Fix:** encode the invariant as a world entry; require downstream work to anchor it.

## Pitfall: Smuggling system mechanics into world
**Symptom:** detailed power rules sit in world entries.  
**Fix:** move mechanics to `spec/system/`; keep world entries about society/environment constraints.

## Pitfall: No enforcement
**Symptom:** institutions exist in name only; rules have no consequences.  
**Fix:** for each rule, state how it is enforced and what happens when violated.

## Pitfall: Unlimited resources
**Symptom:** money, time, logistics, or information feels infinite.  
**Fix:** write explicit ceilings (time, cost, access), and who pays them.
