# World questions (ask only what’s missing)

Use these when `spec/world/` is missing or when scenes feel implausible. Ask the minimum set needed to constrain causality.

## Minimum set (usually enough)

1) **Baseline reality**
- What does an ordinary person’s “default day” look like (work, safety, mobility)?

2) **Institutions + enforcement**
- Which institutions matter (state/corps/guilds/religion/clans/etc.) and what power do they actually have?

3) **Scarcity + resource ceilings**
- What is scarce/expensive/controlled, and who controls it?

4) **Distance, travel, communication**
- How fast can people/objects/information move (and what stops them)?

5) **Hard impossibilities / consequences**
- Name 2–5 things that cannot happen (or cannot happen without major consequence).

## Optional clarifiers (only if needed)

- Social norms that create predictable conflict (taboos, class boundaries, legal constraints).
- Recent history that still shapes behavior (a war, collapse, reform, trauma).
